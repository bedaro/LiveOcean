README for plot5

This is plotting code that evolved from plotting/pan_plot.py.  The name "plot5" is in honor of the original plotting code (by Keiffer?) that I used during my time as a grad student at UW.

The goal is to make a clean slate to rethink how to make LiveOcean movies that include mooring extraction time series and particle tracks.

It is also a chance to re-think the plotting code in general.
